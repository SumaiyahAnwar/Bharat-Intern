Objective:
  Develop a machine learning model to classify SMS messages into spam or ham (non-spam) categories.

Steps:
Data Loading and Exploration:
  Load the SMS dataset and examine its structure.
  Explore the distribution of spam and ham messages.

Data Preprocessing:
  Clean the text data by removing special characters and punctuation.
  Tokenize the messages into individual words.
  Remove stop words and perform vectorization using TF-IDF.

Train-Test Split:
  Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Training:
  Train three classifiers:
    1. Logistic Regression
    2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    3. Neural Network

Model Evaluation:
  Evaluate each model's performance on the testing set.
  Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Visualization:
  Visualize the distribution of spam and ham messages using a count plot or other suitable visualizations.

Additional Considerations:
  Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for each model.
  Explore ensemble methods like VotingClassifier.
  Implement cross-validation for a robust evaluation.
  Consider further feature engineering or the use of pre-trained embeddings.

Deployment:
  If the model performs well, consider deploying it for real-world use in a production environment.
